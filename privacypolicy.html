This Privacy Policy (the "Policy") was adopted in order to disclose what information that our applications collect and the means in which this information is being collected, used and shared.
Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to information submitted and collected by App Mantras through use of the Application and does not apply to information that may be collected by any websites maintained by other companies or organizations to which we may provide links. When you link to these websites, this Privacy Policy no longer applies. We are therefore not responsible for the content or activities provided or created on such sites. Please be advised that all the information contained within the Application is governed by our User Agreement/Terms of use.

For example, we may use cookies to keep track of your preferences and your username and password. Information contained in a cookie may be linked to your personal information for this purpose.

These entries are generated anonymously, and enable us to gather statistics about users' browsing habits, assess overall service activity, track interest in advertised sales, and maintain services' security. We also use the log file entries for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the online services we provide you. Log files are used internally only, and may be combined with data collected via cookies to help us aggregate behaviour patterns of registered users. </p>
